                <h3>Experience all the benefits of Telemedicine!</h3>
                <p>At Skypiatrist, we understand how frustrating and time-consuming it can be dealing with any type of
                    physician appointment. You commute to a clinic and wait an unpredictable length of time to see the
                    doctor for a visit that might be over in 10 minutes. What should be a short, simple appointment
                    takes several hours out of your day.</p>
                <p>Dr. Sandip Buch, a board-certified psychiatrist with more than 10 years in practice, has designed
                    Skypiatrist.com to provide high quality psychiatric care, while maximizing each patient's
                    convenience and privacy. Our visits are always on time. Your prescriptions are sent straight to your
                    pharmacy- no need to drop off paper prescriptions and wait for them to be filled. Not only will you
                    never be forced to wait, you will never be rushed out of an appointment, because if you still have
                    questions/concerns at the end of your appointment, you can schedule another videochat or phone call
                    with the doctor free of charge until all of your concerns have been answered. The doctor is also
                    available by email to answer any questions. This level of privacy and convenience can't be matched
                    by traditional practices.</p>

                <h3>Making better use of technology</h3>
                <p>At Skypiatrist, we use the convenience of modern technology to improve your psychiatric care. Through
                    a secure, HIPAA compliant videochat built right into our website, we provide follow-up in the
                    privacy of your own home, office, or whatever location you choose. You can schedule appointments at
                    a time thats convenient to you (e.g., your lunch hour), even if youâ€™re traveling! The doctor can
                    communicate with you through video conference, phone, and email.</p>

                "Dr. Buch is great and his Skypiatrist remote appointment service is extremely convenient. As someone on
                a consistent dose of psychiatric medication, it was frustrating to spend more time in transit to a
                doctor's office than I actually spent at the appointment. On a purely practical level it's much easier
                to schedule video appointments with Dr. Buch, and I've found no difference in the quality of care
                despite not being physically at his office. Most importantly, Dr. Buch is simply good at what he does.
                He is compassionate, thorough, and has never made me feel like medication or treatment is being thrust
                upon me as a quick fix. I've seen multiple psychiatrists over the course of my life and Dr. Buch is one
                of the best. Quick tip- if you schedule a remote session, be sure to double check that your computer /
                camera / internet connection work beforehand! Dr. Buch's website has a troubleshooting/testing page

                takes away from the experience, which is a testament to Dr. Buch's ability to connect over web cam.
